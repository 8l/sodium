sodium.jar can be built with Java 5 or higher, but it's recommended you use either
Eclipse Xtend or Java 8 for your project so you can use lambda syntax, which makes
reactive code a lot nicer to write.

Xtend can be found at http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/

At the time of writing, you need to use the Project Lambda version of Java 8, which
can be found at http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/
(These changes will eventually become mainstream Java 8.)


BUILD WITH ANT

Ant targets:

    ant clean   <-- clean all built files
    ant jar     <-- build sodium/sodium.jar
    ant tests   <-- build and run the test cases (requires java8 with lambda support)


BUILD WITH ECLIPSE

The 'sodium' directory contains an Eclipse project. Add the project to Eclipse, and then
double click on sodium.jardesc to build the jar file.
