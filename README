Sodium - Reactive Programming in Java, Haskell and C++
(other languages to be added)

This is based on Flapjax, Yampa, scala.React and a number of other Reactive
programming efforts, as well as a lot of personal experience. Enjoy.

Status:
  Haskell - complete
  Java - complete
  C++ - complete (but some polishing needed)
  Embedded-C - just an experiment
